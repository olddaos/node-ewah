Compressed bitset in C++
Daniel Lemire



== What is this? ==

The class EWAHBoolArray is a compressed bitset data structure.

== Licensing ==

Apache License 2.0. (Other licenses are possible.)



== Limitations ==

Because of the compression type being used, you must set the bits
in increasing order (no random access).

== Dependencies ==

None. (Will work under MacOS or Linux easily.)

== Usage ==

make
./unit
make example
./example

== Example ==

Please see example.cpp
